Created a blockchain website 
to solve real world Problems that are now days occuring in many social crowdfunding company some are donating but they dont know where there money is circulating so we provide transparency by building the platform

1-Immutable record-keeping: Blockchain technology allows you to create an immutable record of all transactions that take place on the platform. This can help to ensure the integrity and transparency of the crowdfunding process.

2-Enhanced security: Blockchain technology uses advanced cryptography to secure transactions and prevent tampering. This can help to reduce the risk of fraud and other types of cyber attacks.

3-Decentralization: Because blockchain technology is decentralized, it is not controlled by any single entity. This can help to reduce the risk of a single point of failure and make the platform more resilient to attacks.

4-Increased efficiency: Using blockchain technology can help to streamline the crowdfunding process, reducing the need for intermediaries and improving the speed and efficiency of transactions.
